# Dimensional Energy CAD Model

This file will contain the CAD model for the core components of the Dimensional Energy Transfer System, including:
- Core resonators
- Energy harvesting nodes
- Field stabilizers
- Modular assembly components for integration into both terrestrial and space-based infrastructures.

The model will be developed in SolidWorks/AutoCAD and exported in STL format for 3D prototyping and manufacturing.

# CAD Model: Dimensional Energy Transfer System (Part 2)

This section will focus on the modular assembly of the energy harvesting nodes, designed for optimal placement across various terrain or space-based environments. Each node contains the following key components:
1. Quantum Sensors: Ensuring maximum energy capture from dimensional fields.
2. Resonator Mounts: Securing the resonators to withstand environmental stresses.
3. Stabilization Framework: Integrating field stabilizers to mitigate quantum fluctuations.
4. Power Conduit Interfaces: Facilitating high-efficiency energy transmission to the main power grid.

Design notes:
- All components are constructed with precision alignment tools to ensure dimensional coherence and quantum resonance stability.
- The nodes are modular, allowing for rapid deployment and scalability across large areas or space stations.
- Each node is designed with shock-absorbing mounts to mitigate the effects of seismic activity or micro-meteor impacts (space applications).
