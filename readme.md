# Dimensional Energy Transfer System (DETS)

## Overview
The Dimensional Energy Transfer System (DETS) is an advanced technology designed to harness and transfer energy across different dimensions. Leveraging quantum field resonators, superconductors, and topological insulators, the DETS provides a highly efficient, scalable solution for energy needs on Earth and in space.

## Key Features
- **Quantum Field Resonators:** Extract and transfer energy from higher-dimensional fields.
- **Superconductivity:** Ensure near-zero energy loss during transmission.
- **Topological Insulators:** Maintain quantum coherence and prevent energy backscattering.
- **Scalability:** Modular design supports both terrestrial and space-based applications.
- **Sustainability:** Zero carbon emissions and high energy efficiency.
