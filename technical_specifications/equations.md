# Key Equations for Dimensional Energy Transfer System

## 1. Quantum Coherence Equation
The quantum coherence for resonators is maintained through the following equation:

$$
C(t) = \exp\left(-rac{t}{T_2}ight)
$$

Where:
- \(C(t)\) is the coherence at time \(t\)
- \(T_2\) is the quantum coherence time (in microseconds)

## 2. Energy Transfer Efficiency Equation
The energy transfer efficiency \( \eta \) of the system is modeled as:

$$
\eta = rac{P_{	ext{out}}}{P_{	ext{in}}} 	imes 100
$$

Where:
- \(P_{	ext{out}}\) is the output power
- \(P_{	ext{in}}\) is the input power

## 3. Dimensional Field Stabilization Equation
The field stabilization is modeled by a damped harmonic oscillator, which governs the response time of field stabilizers:

$$
mrac{d^2x}{dt^2} + brac{dx}{dt} + kx = 0
$$

Where:
- \(m\) is the mass of the resonator
- \(b\) is the damping coefficient (related to field fluctuations)
- \(k\) is the spring constant (restoring force)

## 4. Power Output Equation (Max Load)
The maximum power output per node is determined by the following equation:

$$
P_{	ext{max}} = V 	imes I
$$

Where:
- \(P_{	ext{max}}\) is the maximum power output
- \(V\) is the voltage
- \(I\) is the current

These equations form the foundation for modeling the system's quantum coherence, energy efficiency, and power output.
